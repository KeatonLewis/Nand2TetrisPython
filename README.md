# Nand2TetrisPython
A simple implementation of the Nand2Tetris course work using Python 3

The Nand2Tetris coursework can be found here: https://www.nand2tetris.org/course

I am not including every single thing done in the course. The inital hardware implementations and so on will likely not be added.
This repository is primarily for the python files I have made during the course for various tasks like translating assembly code to binary.
If you should want to see any other implementation that I used during the course feel free to let me know and I can look into adding it to 
the repository.
